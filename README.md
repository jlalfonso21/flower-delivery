# Flower Delivery App

## Customized Note
Enabling users to add a personal note with the flowers ordered can be an interesting feature to consider while developing an on-demand flower delivery app. Users will have an option to write a note while placing an order and you can get it printed to deliver with the flowers or bouquet. This feature adds a personal touch and helps users to convey their message.

## Schedule Delivery
Offer your users delivery options to get their order delivered immediately or schedule it for later. They can select the date and time for the scheduled flower delivery and receive it exactly when they want to.

## Real-Time Tracking
Another essential feature is to enable your customers to track their orders in real-time. They must be updated at each step from ‘Preparing the order’ to ‘Order delivered’. By using the geolocation enabled florist app, customers will be able to view the delivery executive’s movements when he is on his way to deliver their order.

## Multiple Payment Modes
Allow your users to pay using various payment methods such as Credit/Debit cards, net banking and popular e-wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal.

## Offers and Deals
Keep showering your customers with regular discounts and personalized offers to make them come running back to you. Earn customer loyalty to retain your existing customers as well as attract other potential customers.

## Social Media Integration
People love to share small events on social media. This feature allows your users to share the flower delivery directly on their social media accounts. This also creates free publicity for your Flower delivery services.
